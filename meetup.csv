We're best known for our terrific technical talks, and our restrictive admission policy of admitting only active iOS Engineers, designers, and product people (actually, any engineer with 1+ year of commercial or open-source experience and a passion for mobile is welcome.)

Every month, we visit the office of a different top employer in New York City. The program is 2 expert speakers each month presenting 20-minute technical talks on what they're working on, with 10 minutes of Q&A each. The rest of the time is for pizza, beer, and hanging out.

We've had super-interesting talks from: Facebook, Google, Yahoo!, Spotify, Foursquare, Tumblr, Thrillist, CocoaPods, Ladders, and more.

You should join if you’re actively involved in the development of mobile technology and you want to learn, meet, and share with others in the space. We'd love to have you as part of our almost 2,000 community!

iOSoho (EYE-oh-SO-ho) is a group for engineers seriously interested in mobile. We only accept active engineers, and serious product and design professionals working in mobile. We do not accept business people, ""entrepreneurs"", marketers, recruiting, ""MBAs seeking co-founders"", or casually interested professionals from other fields. Due to space constraints, as of January 2016, we no longer accept students at code academies, bootcamps, or training programs. Students pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, Engineering, or related degree will be admitted based on demonstrated aptitude.

Basically, if you're not a “fingers on the keyboard” engineer, product person, or designer, this is not the right Meetup for you.

We're very sorry, but in order to keep our Meetup audience, and interactions, at a very technical level, there are no exceptions to these rules.

Finally, due to security requirements at our host buildings for our events, we require your actual first name and last name, as it appears on your ID, on your Meetup account.",2014,952,2013-10-15,20,2,70,0,5,"Mobile Technology, Beginner iOS Developers, Mobile Development, Cocoa Touch, Objective C, iphone application development, iOS, iOS Development, Swift Language",0

Socratic Seminars:

Our Socratic events are formatted to foster debate, information sharing and lively discussion. The first half of the event is dedicated to a wide array of discussion topics: Bitcoin core development (e.g. bitcoin-development mailing list, pull requests, #bitcoin-dev, BIPs), weekly network statistics, building/modifying Bitcoin related software/hardware, scalability, attack vectors, improvements to blockchain logic and other related topics in the ecosystem. Members are encouraged to send the organizer topics they would like to discuss and/or lead discussion on prior to the event. To complete the meeting, members present open source projects, companies, research and other relevant materials. A feedback and Q&A section follow. After the event the group gathers at a nearby restaurant to socialize.

A newsletter is sent out the day of the event which outlines discussion topics. Archives of discussion topics and presentations can be found in the event descriptions of past meetups. The discussion portion of the event is NEVER recorded. It is recommended that you have a firm grasp of the basics of Bitcoin in order to extract the most value from our Socratic events.

Please contact the organizers if you'd like to present at a future Socratic event or have a recommended topic for discussion: bitdevsnyc at gmail. There are different requirements for presentation depending on the type of project.

Whitepaper Wednesdays

A journal club to discuss specific topics in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is an academic-style journal club where one person chooses a topic or paper and presents it. Participants are expected to have read the paper or other material suggested by the discussion leader. The discussion leader doesn’t have to be an expert on the subject, but should be interested enough in it to read the paper thoroughly so as to give a decent presentation. After informally presenting the topic, the group can then ask questions or open discussion surrounding the topic. The presentation should be informal (slides are allowed, but whiteboard/chalkboard is preferred), and this should be a discussion, not a one-way transmission of information by the presenter. The reading material doesn’t have to be a whitepaper. In the case of widely-known topics (such as Elliptic Curve encryption) a chapter of a textbook, Wikipedia article, or other material can be suggested.

To propose a topic to present or volunteer to present a paper, please contact bitdevsnyc at gmail.

CAIM will host a roster of great speakers ranging from research
scientists to venture capitalists, from educational and government institutions to
private companies, from cognitive and computer scientists to economists and investors, with the objective of creating a community of experts and enthusiasts around the topics of Cognitive AI, with a 360 degree view on the topic. We also expect to “raise the bar” a bit compared to the previous meetups, with fewer introductory and tutorial-level presentations and more talks and discussions within a community that is actively working within this space. New York is unique in the global scheme of things, with an amazing variety of industry and public-sector activity in Cognitive AI, and we envision a strong community that can set the standard for the rest of the world.

This is a hands-on user group with the aim of helping you understand Corda in depth. We'll explore Corda technology and help you get up to speed with it.

We work together to design and deliver advanced distributed ledger technologies to the global financial markets. We collaborate with our partner institutions on research, experimentation, design and engineering. This propels the ultimate users of this new technology into the design and production process from the outset.

Corda is R3's implementation of a vision of a future where financial agreements are recorded and automatically managed without error, where anybody can transact seamlessly for any contractual purpose without friction. We believe markets will move towards models where parties to financial agreements record them once and collaborate to maintain accurate, shared records of these agreements. Duplication's, reconciliations, failed matches and breaks will be things of the past. Isolated islands of asset representations will be no more.

**Or Python, Java, C, Perl, Haskell, Bash, PHP, Coq — we're language-agnostic!

What are your meetups like?

We meet at least once a month to hack on projects, give casual 5-minute lightning talks, ask all of our technical questions, and toss around ideas together. It's a great way to make new friends, and to bounce ideas off each other to keep improving our coding skills. We usually have tasty treats of the baked variety and pizza for all of your om-ing and nom-ing needs. We also love to bring in interesting lady speakers, so let us know if you have anything you'd like to hear or talk about!

What if I don’t code?

We are going to be discussing some pretty in-depth, geeky stuff. If you are not deterred by that and are still really excited about coming, you’re more than welcome. A lot of us are more than happy to pay forward all the help we've received along the way, and give you any advice or pointers (pun intended) you might be looking for!

Where can I go to learn to code?

Our friends over at Girl Develop It (https://www.girldevelopit.com/) host excellent classes for folks who just getting started.

Do I have to be a woman?

Yes. If you are a man who is interested in supporting women in tech, please send us a message directly and we'll be happy to provide some other suggestions.

Do you take donations?

Nope. We do this out of love for our community of lady geeks and we think money only complicates things. No money will ever be exchanged here, by anyone.

What emerging industries are emerging from Blockchain tech/How will CME futures affect BTC / is BTC the new gold / What is the biggest threat to crypto currencies / What happens if your the tokens you own are retroactively deemed a security / What does the future of mining look like with regards to energy costs / What are the up and coming ICO's / Brag about your best trade / What t-shirt was Vitalik wearing last week / What is your most trusted source / How do you keep your keys secure / What has been your biggest lesson thus far / How do we get mass adoption / What coin is going to get listed on Coinbase next / How do you get on the dark web / How do I set up my family with ledgers / How do I save money with fees / What strategies do I take given the volatility / Where are the women in technology / Can Blockchain ever be hacked in the future with AI / What will happen to the banks / Who will our future leaders be",267,13,2017-12-01,1,0,7,0,1,"Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Miners, Litecoin, Altcoin, Decentralized Systems, Ethereum, Blockchain, Crypto - Tokens (Ethereum ), Monero, ICO",0

The year 2025, it turns out, is the year many experts predict may be a tipping point that ushers in a new era of innovation for our world. Within approximately 10 years, the most disruptive emerging technologies of our modern era, now in their infancy, will be ""ready for prime time"" and will change society, and how we define ourselves, in unimaginable ways. Are we ready for this seismic shift that will happen in the blink of an eye? Are these new technologies safe? Are we really aware of the challenges and opportunities that are ahead?

Now that we know Trump will be the 45th president, how will his policies impact how we adopt these emerging technologies (including developing legislation to support innovation, and real-world problems as a result of emerging technologies like the loss of millions of jobs forecasted by experts)?

We'll host interactive Workshops, Info Sessions, and larger events (panels and conferences), based on the latest news and trends in emerging technologies, taught by industry experts, in an intimate setting that facilitates think-tank discussions and creative problem-solving, strategizing on real-world applications, and networking.

We strive to be kept up-to-date on all of the important updates in emerging tech, and discuss the latest opportunities for entrepreneurs, corporate managers, marketers, students, technology developers, and anyone who wants to be a part of developing the innovative solutions that will take us into The Fourth Industrial Revolution (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond).

Xcoding — That's what it's all about, right?

https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/1/f/600_466554559.jpeg

We are social programming enthusiasts building World's 1st Algorithmic Innovation Reactor - Code Pile 1.

Join the Human-AI Chain Reaction!

The Chain Reaction that Changed the World

On December 2nd 1942, Enrico Fermi who was leading a group of 49 scientists, conducted the first human-made nuclear chain reaction. The experiment took place at University of Chicago, where the first nuclear reactor in the world - Chicago Pile-1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Pile-1) - was improvised in a squash court. CP-1 was part of one of the largest projects in history - The Manhattan Project (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project), which was initiated by Einstein’s letter to Roosevelt (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd_letter), recommending US Administration to be the first to develop the atomic bomb. The Chicago Pile 1 experiment and the Manhattan Project brought together, in secrecy, the brightest science and technology minds of the world.

Manhattan Project 2017

Did you ever wonder what could be achieved today, 75 years after Chicago Pile 1, if the top minds in business, science and technology would openly collaborate on global projects? Or, since we are in the social networking age, do you think the technology today can help innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world to chain algorithmically their services together in solutions for the most burning business and social problems?

https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAIA_wDGAAAAAQAAAAAAAAoqAAAAJDFkYzA3Mzc0LWJiYTEtNGI1Ny04NTEzLTA5MDg4MDI1MjIyZQ.gif

This was the question that brought together a group of coders and entrepreneurs to register a Meetup and to explore the practical ways to build an internet innovation reactor. Our Meetup was registered initially as Transformative Code Pile 1 Protocol (http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Code-Pile-1-Programming/) to relate via its acronym - TCP1P - both to Chicago Pile 1 (CP-1) and to the TCP/IP the protocol of the Internet. The main idea was to build a new, semantic Internet protocol that will facilitate indexing of projects and services and that will allow development of a mechanism to automatically chain together services into tested solutions for any budgeted and defined projects. The Manhattan Project 2017 (https://www.meetup.com/Transformative-Code-Pile-1-Platform/events/235983793/) started on January 26th and aims to build, by end of November, the infrastructure required for the first code chain reaction experiment on Dec 2nd.

The Smart Internet of PMOs* and COEs**

In our quest for finding the best mankind can do peacefully today, we are using the latest and greatest in science and technology to build a smart Internet as an universal problem solver. To achieve generality for our solver algorithm we combined ideas from some of the greatest problem solvers and project managers of the century.

https://youtu.be/OqCeALixl30

Robert Taylor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)), the ARPANET (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) project director between 1966-69, had three computer terminals in his office, each dedicated to a different project funded by DARPA (https://www.darpa.mil/). One terminal was for the Multics project with MIT, GE and Bell Labs, the second terminal was for connecting with the Systems Development Corporation on their Q32 project - the military planner for the Super Combat Centres in the nuclear bunkers of the Cold War. The third terminal was to connect to the Berkley team working on the Project Genie for the development of one of the first time-sharing systems. Each terminal had a different set of user commands and sharing ideas between project teams meant moving from one terminal to another. For Taylor it was obvious half a century ago the need to have one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That was the Aha moment for the ARPANET that later brought us the TCP/IP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) protocol that is still the backbone data protocol of the Internet today.

Leonid Hurwicz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Hurwicz), a Polish American economist who originated the mechanism design theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) - the Agile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) / TDD (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) version of economics, might have observed that while having just one terminal to connect to any project team, the project manager would still have to switch semantically from one project domain to another. This switch from project to project would be significantly easier (to think of or to compute automatically) if both the projects and the tasks and services in the solution would have public semantic definitions. This way the projects and services can be ranked in a smart market (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_market) that can find algorithmically the optimal combination of services for any given project. Hurwicz, who was borned in Moscow a century ago, was awarded in 2007, the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2007/), together with Eric Maskin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Maskin) from Harvard and Roger Myerson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Myerson) from University of Chicago, for having laid the foundations of the mechanism design theory.

Enrico Fermi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi), the architect of the Atomic Age (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age), would not have thought in the terms of internet sites and web services (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service), but we like to think that he would have designed the project solver algorithm as a chain reaction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_reaction) where a project's context plays the role of nuclei, and business services play the role of neutrons.

As for Chicago Pile 1, he would have designed Code Pile 1 to include enriched graph annotations (https://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-microservices-part-4/) for web services that would increase the probability of a service to interact with a relevant project context thus increasing the revenue for the service owner. Such a Code Reactor would act as a general service compiler when operating on a large market of reactive (https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) AI microservices (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), and the multitude of chain reactions generated will represent a space of possible solutions for a given project. These chains of web services can be indexed by a semantic search engine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine) that could rank them by price, performance or any other computable criteria. Occasionally some of these chains of services will be new, unique solutions for real budgeted projects, fulfilling thus ad literam the definitions for inventions and innovations.

Does it sound complicated? Could an Innovation Reactor ever work? Can the innovators and entrepreneurs of the world wide web make it happen?

We are curious too.

"264","Health 2.0 NYC - The New York Healthcare Innovation Group","New York, NY","This group is dedicated to advancing innovations that focus on improving patient care with the active involvement of Patients, Physicians, Nurses, Administrators, Engineers, and even Lawyers. If your interest is in improving the practice and performance of medicine, than this is the meetup for you.

Eugene Borukovich started the New York Health Innovation Group in 2008. Not long after he affiliated with the Health 2.0 organization and became the first local chapter of the new conference company. Our chapter has since grown to become the largest healthcare innovation focused meetup in the world, running events that focus on specific topics such as the impact of social media in Healthcare or our Startup pitch contest called ""Pitch Yourself into the Shark Tank."" Hundreds of investments, partnerships and collaborations have come from our events, hackathons, contests, and our crowdfunding platform, MedStartr.com. A few of the companies that have presented before they made it anywhere: Phreesia, Zweena, ZocDoc, HelloHealth, Medivo (now Prognos.ai), Avado (bought by WebMD), YourNurseIsOn (acquired), DrChrono, EpionHealth, Healthrageous (acquired), WellApps (acquired), Misfit (acquired for 260M), DocGraph, Register Patient, and over three hundred more as well as StartupHealth and Bluepring health and five other accelerators. We have hosted our own MedStartr Momentum conferences (2015 (http://medmo15.medstartr.com), 2016 (http://medmo16.medstartr.com)), Rise of the Health Machines (http://rise2017.splashthat.com) (2017), HealthCamp, Susannah Fox, Todd Park, Bryan Sivak, Regina Holliday, Esther Dyson, Todd Pietri, and representatives from every major Healthcare Venture Capital and Angel group in the Northeast. The net result is a community of health innovators, accelerators, venture capitalists, hospitals, doctors, patients programmers, and more with a can do attitude that is changing healthcare every day.

We organize this group as our way of saying thanks for helping us launch MedStartr (http://www.medstartr.com).com ...but this isn't about us, it is what our thousands of members, creators and adopters of healthcare innovation can do for healthcare.

Who presents here?

Patients who have defined issues to be addressed and / or designed apps to improve their health and the health of others

Physicians who create innovative care models, develop solutios, or simply are looking for new ways to address the problems they see

Entrepreneurs who create new innovative healthcare solutions

Hospital Executives driving development and adoption of new ideas

Nurses who reinvent nursing management or point of care solutions

Investors, Angels, and VCs looking for the next big thing

Pharma, Insurance, and Diagnostics companies that look for new technologies and companies to work with

Pharmacists who design better medication management, adherence, distribution or other systems

Game Designers who make patient education fun

Quantification companies that help people self-monitor (see also Quantified Self meetup)

Engineers, Programmers, and Hackers that invent and enable new care paradigms

Designers who love to design Killer Apps for Healthy Living

Innovative Government leaders seeking positive change

Reporters and Bloggers who want to see the cutting edge before it happens and spread the word

and so many more amazing people and companies...

Mostly what we have are the leaders of the NYC healthcare innovation scene. By putting us all together in one place, we are creating the future of healthcare and making New York the healthcare innovation capital of the world.

Here is what has happened since we started this group actually: The middle bar is NYC and it shows how much funding has gone into health tech innovations in Boston, NYC, and Silicon Valley over the past few years. It was even worse in 2008 when we started, not even a tenth of Silicon Valley. Now we lead by 49%. Is it due to this meetup group? Maybe. Fact is that when people get together new ideas happen and we get people together. Now there are a dozen healthcare innovation meetup groups in NYC and it only adds to the momentum.

We are always looking for start-ups and individuals to present the ideas or products they are passionate about. Please be welcome to join the conversation, propose a topic, or suggest an alternative format. We are a largely user-driven group, so suggest a topic and we will do the most popular event.

We also enable more established companies to get their message out to the healthcare innovation community through sponsorship and speaking. So if there is an event, challenge, or product release you would like to talk about, please contact us.

We'll regularly get together in coffee shops to learn, to experiment and to share knowledge about Lightning Network, and possibly one day to buy our coffee with a Lightning Network transaction.

What is Lightning Network?
------------------------
Lightning is a decentralized network that enables free and instant Bitcoin transaction, using the power of Bitcoin smart contracts and creating channels. While Bitcoin is growing exponentially and reaching the global scale, the cost and the speed of the network is also increasing exponentially, Lightning Network is the most promising solution that will bring Bitcoin scale to the next level, making it possible to buy a coffee with a Bitcoin, or even to stream music or a movie and to pay with micro-transactions.

aka Holistic Health
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Holistic health (or holistic medicine) is a diverse field of alternative medicine (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine)[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic_health#cite_note-qw-1) in which the ""whole person"" is focused on, not just the malady itself.[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic_health#cite_note-acs-2)

Yoga (Sanskrit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit), Pāli (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li): योग (http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%97) yóga) is a physical (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body), mental (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind), and spiritual (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul) discipline, originating in ancient India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_India).[1] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-0)[2] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-1) The goal of yoga, or of the person practicing yoga, is the attainment of a state of perfect spiritual insight and tranquility while meditating (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation) on Supersoul (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu).[3] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-2) The word is associated with meditative practices in Hinduism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), Jainism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism) and Buddhism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism).[4] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-3)[5] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-4)[6] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-Tattvarthasutra_2007_p._102-5)

Within Hindu philosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy), the word yoga is used to refer to one of the six orthodox (āstika (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80stika_and_n%C4%81stika)) schools of Hindu philosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_philosophy).[7] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-6)[8] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-7) Yoga in this sense is based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali), and is also known as Rāja Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C4%81ja_Yoga) to distinguish it from later schools.[9] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-8) Patanjali's system is discussed and elaborated upon in many classical Hindu texts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts), and has also been influential inBuddhism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) and Jainism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism). The Bhagavad Gita (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita) introduces distinctions such as Jnana Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_Yoga) (""yoga based on knowledge"") vs. Karma Yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Yoga) (""yoga based on action"").

Other systems of philosophy introduced in Hinduism during the medieval period are bhakti yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_yoga), and hatha yoga (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga).[10] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads1_042007-9)[11] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads2_042007-10)[12] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-yogaTrads_3042007-11)

The Sanskrit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) word yoga has the literal meaning of ""yoke"", from a root yuj meaning to join, to unite, or to attach. As a term for a system of abstract meditation or mental abstraction it was introduced by Patañjali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pata%C3%B1jali) in the 2nd century BC. Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi) or yogini (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogini).[13] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-12)

The goals of yoga are varied and range from improving health to achieving moksha (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha).[14] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-Jacobsen.2C_p._10-13) Within the Hindu monist (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism) schools of Advaita Vedanta (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta), Shaivism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism) and Jainism, the goal of yoga takes the form of moksha, which is liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death (samsara (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsara)), at which point there is a realization of identity with the Supreme Brahman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman). In the Mahabharata, the goal of yoga is variously described as entering the world of Brahma (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma), as Brahman, or as perceiving the Brahman or Ātman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)) that pervades all things.[15] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-14) For the bhakti (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti)schools of Vaishnavism (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism), bhakti or service to Svayam Bhagavan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svayam_Bhagavan) itself may be the ultimate goal of the yoga process, where the goal is to enjoy an eternal relationship with Vishnu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu).[16] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga#cite_note-15)",3212,0,2008-04-14,4,0,0,0,0,"Life Transformation, Self Exploration, Healthy Living, Social, Alternative Medicine, Wellness, Fitness, Yoga, Outdoors, Meditation, Holistic Health, Self-Empowerment, Spirituality, Self-Improvement, Hiking",0

This is Meetup is for IT-managers, c-suite execs, DevOps, software developers, programmers, business and product developers, and anyone who is at the forefront of defining and implementing Digital Transformation strategies for enterprise companies.

We are living in an unprecedented time of change and opportunities for businesses as emerging technologies like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and more, revolutionize ""business-as-usual"" and companies are forced to digitally transform their entire organizations and systems to meet the demands of new technologies or get left behind.

• How will this impact how companies develop their own technologies (both in-house and for consumers)?

• How does this change the relationship between brands and their customers?

• Which technologies are at the forefront of innovating the enterprise and how are companies using them to reinvent their organizations and business models?

• And, with all of this potential to use technology to streamline and grow business, why are 84% of companies failing at executing successful digital transformation initiatives?

TECHNOLOGIES COVERED

Automation technologies, AI, machine learning, agile techniques and technologies, information architecture, mobile app development, security technologies, big data, the cloud, IoT, fintech, healthtech, insuretech.

WHAT WE'LL COVER

(2) companies that are both winning and struggling to adopt and implement digital transformation and how they're doing it;

(3) people, companies, and tools at the forefront of defining and leading the digital transformation revolution and their strategies;

(4) company procedures, practices and structures that undergoing massive change and how it is impacting how employees work;

J is a functional language but with imperative forms for flexibility. You can write J in both a purely functional manner - called ""tacit"" - or in an ""impure"" functional form - called ""explicit"" - with some constructs that mirror more conventional languages.

"411","N-Languages","New York, NY","This group was originally formed to make its way through the book ""Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages,"" by Bruce Tate. The book is a quick deep-dive into seven very different languages: Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure and Haskell.

We found we enjoyed hearing about a new language every month, so much that we decided to continue the group after the end of the book. It seemed that there was a place for a group that gives programmer-level (but not too scary!) introductions to languages that members have always heard about but haven't ever delved into. Some languages are too obscure to have their own Meetup groups, but even for the ones that aren't, sometimes you want an overview of the key features of a language and what makes it special, which you might not always get at a Meetup devoted to that language, among people who are already familiar with it.

As of this writing, we've had talks on (in addition to the languages listed above) Python, OCaml, Go, JavaScript, Smalltalk, J, K, Verilog, Nim, and Perl. If you've got a language you'd like to hear on intro on, join the group and make a suggestion!

We have a Slack channel (http://nlang-slack-inviter.herokuapp.com/) where we hang out and chat about programming languages, tech, and other related items. You can sign up for Slack here:

"412","Dinner with Developers","New York, NY","Share a good meal with fellow programmers, coders, and software engineers! It does not matter if you are a hardened professional or merely an enthusiastic, amateur hacker! It makes no difference what language you prefer, nor what systems you target! We are platform independent!

Every month we will have a different Default Topic to initialize our discussions with. Though, we are also free to go off on sub-topics, a little, if we feel like it. And, we might loop through different restaurants in the city each month, as well. There is no fee to join us. However, you are responsible for your own restaurant bill.

Note about the Name: Yeah, I know the ""with"" statement is obsolete in most languages. I was originally going to call it ""Dinner for Developers"", but that sounded too much like a charity cause.",249,4,2014-05-03,3,1,12,0,1,"Web Design, Software Development, Web Development, Web Programming, developer, Computer programming",0

Do you have an event to share with our Future Technology or Futurism NYC Meetup members?

While the Organizer will ideally host one event per quarter, similar to Bay Area Futurists, this Meetup has a flat organizational structure. Therefore, all members are invited to host events for the Future Technology community, however you must connect with the Organizer and get permission to post about your event, otherwise it will be removed from the Meetup page. Collaborations and co-promotions are encouraged and can be facilitated by the Organizer. Don't hesitate to reach out/email us with any questions, comments or ideas. We're here to help and we're excited to build on this exponentially exploratory topic with you!

Talks, workshops, hackathons, movie screenings, company visits, parties, group trips, and other types of events are welcome. We're especially interested in inviting leading futurists from around the world to speak. If you know of someone that might be a good fit, please connect with the Organizer so we can bring this opportunity to reality.

Liability Waiver can be found at the bottom of the page.

We look forward to seeing you and getting you more involved in Future Technology!

"444","NY Graph Meetup","New York, NY","NY Graph is a place for people to learn about and discuss graph structures, graph theory, graph databases and related topics. We host technical presentations and lectures, product demos, lightning talks, seminars, town hall-style open forums and hands-on tutorials, in addition to less-structured monthly gatherings.

Why graphs? Why now?
Graph structures and methods are being used everywhere. As the size of datasets being generated, processed, and presented continues to grow, the relative strengths and weaknesses of different data structures, including graphs, have become more and more significant in everyday applications. Meanwhile, wider awareness of graph concepts (thanks in large part to the popularity of online social networks and widespread adoption of machine learning techniques) has increased the use of graph methods in a variety of fields. As a result, the last few years have seen renewed interest in academic circles, and a large number of companies and independent efforts putting a great deal of effort into creating faster, more scalable, and more reliable graph databases and ever more powerful interfaces.

Am I missing something? What are graphs?

The Data is Open and available, published and used by governments and civil society, the private sector and multi-stakeholder organizations. Open Data is transforming communication, improving productivity, and driving transparency and accountability. Governments in Africa are using Data to benchmark Sustainable Development, to document the informal economy, increase economic diversity and growth. These are just a few small examples of how Data is transforming what we know about our world, how to change it, and how to measure the impact of our changes.

Data is a raw material for new applications and communication between the government and the public, the public and the government, and within the government itself. Data has value when it is utilized, and utility can only be maximized when people find Data engaging and interesting, easy to find and share, worth talking about and using.

It's like a story in the newspaper. The best background research can't make a poorly written story fascinating. It has to be well written, beautifully designed, documented, and presented to inspire and engage audiences in an ongoing conversation.

This is why we believe that Open Data is a tool for communication, and that the subject of the communication itself is what matters. In The Africa Data Revolution we want to use Open Data ""tools"" to communicate about Art and Science; Climate Change and Gender Equality; Economic Growth and Social Progress; The Rule of Law and Open Government; Childhood Development and Smart Cities; Broadband Adoption and the development of new digital industries; Old Media and Natural Resources; Farming and Transportation. It can be about any and all topics relevant to anyone interested in Africa.

"483","New York City Privacy Advocates","New York, NY","https://privacyboard.nyc

#NYCPrivacy supporters demand that the city create strong policies and oversight to keep pace with a torrent of new technologies which have the potential for unintended disclosure of individuals’ data.

The public should be allowed into the policy discussion concerning the fate of their own information, specifically in deciding what gets protected and from whom.

Having a strong citywide policy, for example, could prevent the LinkNYC advertising partners from collecting data from bystanders. As it is, the LinkNYC privacy policy only protects users of the free WIFI service, not the general public. This is a great concern since this data collection is a very real technical possibility.

#NYCPrivacy advocates for the creation of a Privacy Guidelines Board to advise city legislators and agencies in the creation of policies that will protect our data from being misused, as well as to serve as a conduit for receiving the community’s concerns.

#NYCPrivacy draws inspiration from the successes of the advisory boards in Seattle and Oakland, which have been created to address the privacy concerns that new technology presents.

#NYCPrivacy’s position is that as New York City integrates ever more powerful technologies into a large population center, a privacy guidelines board representing citizens is urgently needed.

It is Venture Collaboration.

In New York's competitive venture climate, entrepreneurs often lack the business connections and brand awareness to get the attention of potential funders, and at the same time many investors don't have a pipeline into early-stage technology and Internet companies. The Hatchery provides a unique funnel for innovators to interact with a wide range of investors, present their plans, receive expert feedback, bring in strong leadership, and pave the way for them to receive angel and institutional funding. At the heart of The Hatchery's model is the Gauntlet, an interactive process that gives entrepreneurs 7 minutes to present their business models to a range of investors, followed by panel and audience Q&A/critique. Think of it as ""American Idol meets Venture Capital.""

WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?
- Great early stage businesses who would like this priceless expert feedback and looking to meet investors.

Are You Serious:
- 5 minutes to present your concept to the panel. 5 minutes of grilling to see if the concept holds.
- To submit to present: pitch@hatchery.vc

Gauntlet:

Did you know that there is a NEW VERSION OF PLF? IT's called Product Launch Formula (http://www.DevonJoseph.com/plf) 4.0 (http://www.DevonJoseph.com/plf)

Internet marketers know the legendary power of the Product Launch Formula. It's responsible for over $100 million worth of product launches in a wide range of niches. Practically every major online product launch is powered by it.

Whether you are a product owner or online marketer, no matter what market niche you are targeting, join the group and get the most out of Jeff Walker's online product launch techniques. We're looking to foster a real sense of community and help out with advice about each other's launches.

This meetup group is now managed by Devon Joseph, an experienced Product Launch formula owner. Originally founded by Hubert Lee, a Jeff Walker trained Product Launch Manager and member of Jeff Walker's exclusive Platinum coaching group. Hubert received intense personal training from Jeff Walker and his group of ""Marketing Gods"" (including Frank Kern and Eben Pagan). Hubert continues to receive coaching directly from Jeff Walker.

Hubert has started this Product Launch Formula meetup group with a clear sense of abundance. Under the leadership of Mr. Devon Joseph, we are looking to share knowledge and passion for online product launch management, strategy and techniques. He'll catch you up with what's been going on in the world of Jeff Walker and the Product Launch Formula.

Here's a link to catch up with what Jeff Walker is up. He has a great video of how Product Launch Formula powered the recent multi-million dollar ""Big Guru Launches"" :

"575","Hacks/Hackers New York City","New York, NY","The worlds of hackers and journalists are coming together as reporting goes digital and Internet companies become media empires.

Journalists call themselves ""hacks,"" someone who can churn out words in any situation. Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code. Hacker-journalists try and bridge the two worlds.

This group is to bring all these people together — those who are working to help people make sense of their world. It's for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories. In the age of information overload, all their work has become even more crucial.

This group aims to help members find inspiration and think in new directions, bringing together potential collaborators for projects and new ventures.

What originally started as a forum (NYTechWomen) for women who were active and passionate about technology, quickly became so much more. Since May 2011, NYTechWomen has been changing the tech environment for women in NYC. In March 2013, it became incredibly clear that the environment needed to change for women outside of NYC as well, and Bella Minds was born. Publicly launching on October 17th with a crowdfunding campaign, 52 days later, after successfully raising $28,692 from 263 backers, we hit the road with our tried and tested curriculum.

We’re very proud of the wonderful community we have all built together, first supporting New York women in technology, and now supporting all women interested in technology.

There are now thousands of community members, but our elbows-down approach hasn't changed one bit. We're still having regular NYC-based events, continuing in the NYTechWomen tradition, but we've added many, many more programs as well. So, be sure to join us at our next event, and contact us if you are interested in helping us close the digital divide for even more women, taking the power of technology to every woman who wants it.",1698,43,2011-05-18,27,0,99,0,1,"Web Technology, Entrepreneurship, Women Entrepreneurs, Startup Businesses, ""Womens Social"", ""Womens Business Networking"", Young Entrepreneur, Entrepreneur Networking, Online Marketing, Internet Professionals, Women in Technology, New Technology, Technology, New York City",1

1-We all enjoy Technology.

2-We can all benefit from one another.

The NYC Gadget/Tech Group was established to give people with different levels of tech/gadget love a social space, in which to share and learn from each other.

The people who should join are those who want to help others get the most out of what they have first, only encouraging new purchases when what the person wants to do is beyond the capacity of what they have. People who want to find out what others are doing with their equipment/devices and what is soon to come or already out but hardly known should join. Those who want to become more proficient and efficient with their devices should join.

A message to our dear prospective/potential power users:

This cruel game of tech division spun by big business in an effort to monopolize profits is not what this group is about.

Love your brand? Great. Love collective capability more.

If you are a power user, only join this group if you can see the vital difference between the love of a single brand and the power of a cross-brand collective. Join only if you can help compare technologies without urging competition/division within the group.

We are here to build, not battle.

If you are interested in a common web strategy for mobile, tablet and desktop then Responsive Web Design NYC is right for you!

This group was the first NYC Responsive Web Design Meet-up launched in Sept 2011 with the spirit of serving the design, developer, product management and business community of NYC around all topics pertaining to Responsive Web Design. Anyone from the community can organize, participate and run an event! We are very fortunate to have great sponsors that will help with venues and refreshments!

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is essentially a web design process leveraging W3C CSS3 media queries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS3) with fluid proportion-based grids, to adapt the layout to the viewing environment, and probably also including flexible images. As a result, users across a broad range of devices and browsers will have access to a single source of content, laid out so as to be easy to read and navigate with a minimum of re-sizing, panning and scrolling.

Some Key Topics ( and we can cater to yours as well!)

Learning the basics and essentials of RWD

Learning from different experts about the designs they have implemented (CASE STUDIES)

Deep discussions around the RWD process

Monetization techniques of RWD

Technical review of tools and frameworks such as SASS/COMPASS

And anything the group proposes.....

The style of the meet-up is very participatory with each meet-up catering to the requests of the group for the next meet-up!

If you are interested in being a co-organizer, that would be great! Email me. matt.snyder@responsiveads.com

Does your job require frequent presentations or public speaking tasks? Has your Headhunter told you that your resume is outstanding, but you interview poorly? The 21-century demands so much more from everyone involved in business. The late Steve Jobs has changed the world of business in an almost unnoticed but highly disruptive way. All members of an organization are now expected to act as branding agents for products. Look at CES 2012, thousands of behind the scenes men and women were expected to create a “REALITY DISTRORTION FIELD” for new products. Even today’s investors want to invest in someone who can sell their product with charisma. In a google-based world, features and benefits presenting and selling will ensure professional failure.

In this world you need an edge! Expect a warp speed jump in your ability to present, persuade, lead others (leadership) and get your ideas across to an audience of one or many. Face-to-face communication is where term sheets are traded.

Effective Pitching and Presenting NEEDS Persuasion Knowledge

This NOT just another meetup group, but expect a doorway into high horse power persuasion training. You will learn to design, package and deliver your message for any audience. Persuasion science— All communication is Brain to Brain. Would you ever use an ATM blindfolded? Why would you conduct important communications without first understanding how your words and body affect other brains. When persuasion is done right, it is absolutely invisible to your audience. Persuasion is about moving your audience attention and viewpoint towards your goals.

Build Amazing Self-expression skills with Stage presence

Pitching with Persuasion Art and science

Investor motivations recognition and message packaging

Narrative crafting

Subliminal communication

Defeat Fears and Anxieties

This meetup group is your opportunity to overcome fears and anxieties around public presentations using rapid change techniques. We do NOT use quick motivational fixes were you fall flat on your face the next day.

Get Fast Results

A number of accelerated learning formats are used to help you achieve your communication goals in a cost and time effective manner. We use a learn-by-doing process of running simulations that mirror the conditions you must present within.

Team pitching will also be covered—do you have a team or group of people that must present to investors.

""Health"" involves an unbelievably complex system (the body), tangled up with an unfathomably real abstraction (the mind) and wrapped in a morass of business, government, and good intentions so labyrinthine in nature that it would make Kafka cry. If you love exploring elegant fixes to problems of mind-shattering difficulty in a collaborative environment then Health Devs is the group for you.

Things health devs do:

* Show off hacks we've built that transform health and healthcare

* Share information on the nuts and bolts of developing healthcare technologies -- everything from hacking healthcare's many non-standard ""standards"" to building great UI for doctors to integrating with EHRs

* Talk about the core problems of plaguing healthcare, and how to hack them",1195,9,2012-07-01,6,0,18,0,4,"Biotechnology, Wellness, Professional Networking, Medical, Technology, Computer programming, Entrepreneurship, Healthcare Innovation, Healthy Living, Web Technology, Healthcare IT, Science Based Medicine, New Technology, Hacking, Quantified Self",0

By using the apps during the demos rather than just watching, attendees can give better feedback and the demos are more fun because presenters tailor them for audience participation.

Digital Health Research encompasses a wide range of research approaches that all have a digital component. These approaches include digital logs and diaries, experience sampling, ecological momentary assessment, ambulatory assessment, sensor-based research, and real-time interventions. Health-relevant outcomes of interest range from specific experiences and behaviors (such as affect and physical activity) to physiological states, location data, and social interactions. Our focus is on integrating theoretical models, study design, and statistical analyses to improve assessment and interventions in digital health research.

We welcome anyone interested in health outcomes and mechanisms of change. We seek out presenters with data relating to digital assessment or interventions from studies and consumer databases. Our goal is to understand how to help people improve their health and well-being through big and small data.

The best way to think about the Digital Health Research Meet-Up is like a mini-conference every couple of months with individuals presenting their research. We will have between 2-3 presenters at each meet-up with 10-15 minutes of presentation time and 10 -15 of discussion. Individual meet-ups will eventually have specific themes.

"879","Oracle Developers NYC","New York, NY","Welcome to Oracle Developers NYC! Are you trying to make the most out of application development using the latest technologies? So are we. Join us so we can learn together!

Here are some of the technologies we love to champion:

Oracle Application Express (APEX)

APEX is a declarative framework for building web applications on the Oracle database. Using only a browser, and with just basic knowledge of application development, it is possible to create robust, secure, and scalable web applications. APEX applications utilize the latest HTML5 and CSS3 technologies and even include a feature named Dynamic Actions that can add JavaScript to applications without having to write any code.

Oracle JET

To assist developers working on JavaScript based, single-page applications (SPAs), Oracle developed the JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET). JET is a collection of open-source JavaScript libraries, combined with a set of Oracle-contributed JavaScript libraries that make it as simple and efficient as possible to build applications that consume and interact with Oracle products and services.

Note: while we think Oracle JET is a great choice for building enterprise JavaScript apps, we’re certainly not opposed to using other technologies. AngularJS, Ember.js, React, Vue.js, and all the others are welcome too!

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)

These days, front-end developers want their data in JSON format, but not all data is best persisted in JSON format. For many applications, the relational model will be the best way to store data. With ORDS, we can have the best of both worlds. We can use the many features of Oracle Database to build a robust, scalable persistence layer and then use ORDS to expose that layer RESTfully.

Node.js Driver

Node.js, the platform that allows JavaScript to run on the server, has become very popular over the past few years. To best support this rapidly growing community, Oracle developed a new driver to allow Node.js to connect to Oracle Database. Now it’s possible to put the power of Node.js to work on your data!

Oracle Database

Introduced in 1979, this was the world’s first commercially available Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) database. Today it ranks as the world’s most popular database technology (http://db-engines.com/en/ranking). There are many topics to cover here, including core concepts (architecture, concurrency & consistency, transactions, etc.), SQL, PL/SQL, database design, tools (such as SQL Developer), tuning, and more.

Our History: This group started as an APEX specific meetup on April 22, 2014 before widening the focus to Oracle development on December 1, 2016.",212,23,2014-04-22,6,0,22,0,3,"Oracle APEX Development, CSS, Software Development, JavaScript, HTML5, Oracle, Web Development, Database Development, Database Professionals, Oracle Business Solutions, web application development, Oracle E Business Suite",0
"880","Product Secrets","New York, NY","Product Secrets is a monthly meetup where we invite an expert on a specific topic to teach us their secrets and help people in product development do their jobs better. We think that the best way to solve the challenges that come up in product development are to get everyone involved in a room together - if engineers, designers, and product managers can all have an open conversation together, we think they're much more likely to come up with good ideas.

We were tired of all the meetups we went to being uninspiring and full of recruiters, so we built the meetup we've always wanted. Each month, we host an expert in a specific topic to answer the question ""What's your secret?"" The goal is to help everyone who attends learn something that can help them take a new skill or idea with them to work the next day. We also have a strong focus on networking, because making connections with other interesting people is where we think most of the value in these meetups lies.

Important: this meetup is for product managers, engineers, designers, and other people actively working on a digital product (support specialists, QA engineers, company founders, etc). To that end:

• Fill out your member profile accurately and completely. As each event fills up and the waitlist grows, we will give priority to people who make it clear what they're doing, what they can contribute, and what they want to learn.

• Recruiters are strictly prohibited from attending. Business development and marketing professionals are welcome to attend if they are interested in product development, but people with a more direct involvement will get priority in the case of an oversold event.",1218,23,2014-04-29,11,0,14,0,2,"Software Development, Product Design, iOS Development, Mobile Development, User Experience, Engineering, Internet Startups, Product Development, Android Development, Web Development, Mobile Design, Product Management, Technology Startups",0

• Web UI for viewing cluster state

One way to think about the difference between Mesos and ""cloud"" solutions is around how they manage their resources. There is a lot of latency when using Hypervisors (which is what cloud environment use). Mesos operates with cgroups at the kernel level giving you the same isolation but faster from a network, and system perspective.

Mesos also abstracts out the scheduling of resources from the management of resources giving you the ability to create any type of scheduler that makes sense for you (or use existing ones) and still get the same kernel benefits. Think of your scheduler as init.d for your data center servers as a whole and Mesos as the kernel of your entire data center and every computing server in it.",1084,23,2014-05-09,1,0,24,0,1,"Apache, Open Source, Big Data, High Scalability Computing, information Retrieval",2

Converged Infrastructure New York City group (CINYC) is a forum for gaining awareness and exchanging ideas around practical benefits of convergence of business and technology.

We are sensitive to the dichotomy that often exists between various groups in large organizations and we are passionate about taking a collaborative approach to closing such gaps. We are here to learn, to help each other recognize and reap rewards promised by convergence of infrastructure - a relatively new trend focused on lowering the cost of operating cloud environments by engineering and packaging technology stacks.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converged_infrastructure

We exist to help facilitate meetups where professionals & end-users can share best practices for valuing, deploying and operating CI technologies. Professionals and experts can become aware of new market needs, and new users can gain practical knowledge, expand their foundations about market trends; everyone can grow their professional network. The collaborative cross-organizational approach to implementing CI and harnessing its benefits encourages sharing of ideas, giving rise to sharing best practices - for everyone’s benefit.

Join us if your areas of interest include business transformation, DevOps, use-cases, lessons learned as part of improved organizational re-alignment, as well as intersections of economics and technology.

"927","Monitoring NYC","New York, NY","We'd like to share experiences building scalable monitoring and alerting solutions using Graphite, Grafana, Collectd, Nagios, Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana, among others.

We believe that it is easy to collect metrics from any one system, and to define alerts on single metrics. We already have this capability in place. However, in complex systems, the real operational challenges arise from the way system components interact. Some of these components live inside our data center, some live outside our data center, and all are updating on differing timelines. The functionality and performance of every component has the potential to change every day.

Our challenge is to identify patterns and correlations across multiple systems in our stack. We need to integrate top-down and bottom-up analysis, so we can see, for example, that trial subscription signups (a user metric) fell off at the same time that an internal API call began to fail (an application metric), and it was caused by a database host falling offline (a system metric).

When collecting so much data, there is a risk of being overwhelmed and not being able to make sense of it all. In essence, a risk of collecting data but not producing intelligence. We combat this risk by converting our accumulated data into the most visually information-dense format available: graphs. Then we make graphs easy to compare and easy to share. We make them informative at a glance and easy for the team to keep watching. Finally, once we are regularly identifying patterns across our graphs, we should have an automated way to ""watch the graphs"" in our absence. It is not an AI or a pattern recognition ""black box"", it should just automate patterns that humans have first validated to be meaningful.",568,5,2014-09-08,3,0,5,0,4,"Software Development, Cloud Computing, Operations and Data Center Management, Technology Startups, Technology, New Technology, Web Performance, Application Performance Monitoring, Monitoring, DevOps, Dev Ops, Metrics, Configuration Management, System Administration, Application Performance Management",0

Adding a little bit of history to the purpose of this group, I would like to mention my interest in Eurythmics, which was the study of harmony and proportion, by observation of beauty in mathematical ratios, a concept proposed by Pythagoras.

Eurhythmics could be used to analyze and create all forms of art: music, painting, architecture, etc., and until the middle ages, subjective and objective branches of knowledge such as arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy (bundled with astrology) thrived together and united as a group known as the Quadrivium.

During that time, knowledge of the Quadrivium was considered a pre-requisite for the study of philosophy, but it fell apart in the Renaissance, when mathematicians became increasingly uninterested in the arts because no theory had successfully provided a link between aesthetics and proportion.

Within the context of data science and artificial intelligence, I hope this group allows participants to discuss and share views to help establish analytical links in the fields or arts, science, and creativity.

It can get lonely for anyone trying to blog her way to the top. That’s why we formed The Blogger Babes. It’s not just an association – it’s more like a sisterhood. We help each other out, from sharing useful tips to collaborating with members to create awesome content together.

You’ll benefit from our experienced bloggers - those that have been blogging for quite a while and who actually make a living from their blog - to our handy tips and tools , networking opportunities and the educational webinars we coordinate at least twice a month.

We offer some pretty exciting (and exclusive) stuff:

· Socializing and Networking Opportunities: Hang out with your fellow bloggers, both in person and virtually! We organize parties, meetups and webinars for our Blogger Babes.

· Exclusive Content: Hone your skills, cultivate new ideas and pick up a few tips with our content – ebooks, articles, webinars and more! Only available to Blogger Babes members.

·Support: The Blogger Babes are a friendly bunch – and we encourage members to reach out to one another, to make friends, collaborate, give encouragement and seek advice from members. You can’t do everything by yourself, and you shouldn’t have to when your fellow blogger babes are such excellent sources of support.

Goodies & Gifts & Sponsored Opportunities: We're continuously working to find sponsors for our bloggers. It's a win-win situation for both parties - our sponsors get exposure and feedback about their products & services, and our bloggers get to try out new products and services for free . This also gives a chance for our newer bloggers to learn how to review products the right way ( yes, there is a right and wrong way to write spectacular product reviews that will keep your sponsors coming back and your readers clamoring for more..).

Does this all sound exciting? Come join us and start blogging better now, and do tell all the other bloggers in your life to join the Blogger Babes movement.

* Who should join:

We have three types of members:

1) Those trying to learn to code.

2) Those strong in one area (like frontend development) but looking to grow in other areas

3) Those already strong in general (like an average full stack developer) but looking to stay current with tools in the field

* Why should members join:

The central goal of Developer Unicorns is to create a group of people who keep each other abreast of the most current technologies in the world of mobile and web development. This includes front end, backend, big data, and industry specific knowledge.

Members should join if they want to meet other folks trying to learn more about software development, if they want to make new friends in the tech space, or if they just love learning about current technology.

* What can members expect out of the group:

There are two types of events that our community holds regularly - lecture style talks and workshop style events.

During the lecture style talks a topic is introduced and a lecture is given. This covers a high level overview of the topic and shows you some examples of how to use the technology being discussed. This could be a technology stack, a design pattern, a new language, a framework, or a new piece of hardware, etc.

During the workshop style event members are given the option to work on discrete exercises or hack on their own project using the topic discussed during the previous lecture style talk. This way any skills are reinforced AND the members with more questions can ask the lecturer something specific.",904,5,2015-02-12,3,0,16,0,3,"Open Source, Software Development, Web Technology, Web Development, Computer programming, Polyglot Programming, Full Stack Development",0

It was 1999. Looking back, I realize that my research is a joke compared to what you can do today.

What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time. That is why I decided to contribute my time and evangelize importance of this non-profit organization among artificial intelligence enthusiasts in New York. Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.

If you care to help - drop me a line with any ideas or suggestions you might have. Or simply say hello and introduce yourself because I would like to learn about you and the projects you are working on! See you soon!

Presentations are demo focused and not sales pitches. Speakers at our Meetups thus far have included Google, Red Hat, CoreOS, Datadog, New Relic, and Apprenda.

This group follows these three central ideas:

• We believe in open sponsorships, so anyone can cover the cost of food, space, and travel for speakers. To not price out smaller vendors, sponsorship prices are not set beyond the cost. Organizations donating speakers, food/drinks, or space will automatically count as sponsors for the event.

• We believe in democratized organization, so anyone in the Kubernetes community that wants to help organize can be a part of process.

• We believe that all Kubernetes Meetups should be democratic and those that do not allow others to take part in organizing and sponsoring are not in the spirit of open source.

To become an organizer, sponsor, or to speak at the event, please reach out to the event organizers.

ALL ORGANIZERS WELCOME!

Here's an FAQ-style description of what Hack Club is:

# What is the goal of Hack Club?
To provide an environment where we can all grow as programmers.

# Who can come?
Anyone interested in programming!

# How does it work?
Come with your laptop and an open mind! There will be a conference room booked for everyone to sit in but there are no lectures or assigned work; everything you do will be self-guided. Feel free to pair program, ask for help on a side project or just spend time learning something that’s been in your personal backlog for weeks.

# What are the rules?
* There are no ‘dumb questions’
* No ‘work-work’ allowed. There are already plenty of work hours for that :)

These rules are put in place to help us promote growth and make sure this doesn’t become extended work hours. We also subscribe to the ideas that Recurse Center has created ( https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment ) around building a programming environment for learning.

# What does the night look like?
* Before the event - tell us what you're working on ( http://bit.ly/2bCq1zj )!
* First 15-30 minutes - food and check-ins
* Next 2.5 hours - hack by yourself or with a friend

"1371","Change the World with Data, Behavior, and Game Design NYC","New York, NY","Sign up for updates and our free tutorials here http://katiepatrick.com

You may have heard the saying, “If you can’t measure it, it probably doesn’t exist.”

This meetup is an interactive workshop designed to help you get better at measuring what you want to change, and getting really good at changing it. It's for social change professionals to learn how to better collect real world data and implement behavior-change techniques to change the world. We generally focus on environmental sustainability and smart cities, but your unique social change cause is welcome too! Simply disclosing data has enormous potential to catalyze change. We will peek into the surge in new data being collected in smart cities by satellites, drones and sensors, and the exciting start ups using this data for environmental change. We ask the questions “What are you measuring and how are you measuring it?” and “What will this future world look like when you have have achieved your goal?”. We cover hardware, sensors, data collections methods, data science, feedback loops, systems theory, cybernetic ecology, goal setting, project vision, ideas, creativity, community based social marketing, behavior-change, behavioral psychology, data visualization, advocacy techniques, game design, gamification and UI/UX design. We show how to use these features in a feedback loop of real environmental data as function of ‘agency’ (or motivation) in game design. We show how you can use these techniques to add massive creativity and idea-storming to your cause. We teach the practical how-to of community based social marketing, the principle of social diffusion (imitation) and how to use narrative design from The Hero's Journey when selling sustainable behaviors. **

The goal is to facilitate that mission by creating a platform in which the technologies of the future can match and begin to solve the problems of the present. We focus on solving 5 main global challenges, adapted from the 17 global challenges set forth by the United Nations.

GlobalTech.City mediates that. Through the use of global events, now located in 90+ cities, we have created a community for sharing tech solutions, including but not limited to big data, blockchain, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. The events of GlobalTech.City allow groups spanning from start-ups and scale-ups to educational institutions, corporations, investors and average citizens to extend the reach of their technological solutions and create a global network of problem solving.

IMPORTANT: Please fill out this form to be matched with an interview group/partner: https://goo.gl/forms/V3DX4gW06MdCf5173

Once you're matched with an interview partner, you will both reach out to each other to set up a time/venue for your practice session. A suggested practice session format is as follows: each person should bring several questions (whether algorithms, design, coding, or other relevant category) that they are intimately familiar with (e.g., from past interviews). During the session, each person will take 1 turn as interviewer and 1 turn as the interviewee. Each turn should last around 45 minutes.

The Ocean Data Alliance was created to define a new vision of Ocean Observation that generates massive volumes of data about our coastal zones, ocean surface, near depths, deep subsurface regions, seabed, chemistry, biology, marine ecosystems, temperatures, currents, and weather.

The current market for ocean observation is driven by science and science isn’t adequately funded. To unlock future commercial potential, large new funding sources will be needed to create artificial market demand that stimulate investments in new ocean data collection, spurring private sector innovation, skills, and capacity.

The data that is already produced is collected by nations, universities, NGO’s, and shipping companies but only a small percentage is Open Data and scarcely available. Data creates more value when it is widely utilized and well governed. Helping organize to improve data infrastructure, quality, integrity, and availability is a requirement for achieving new ocean data-driven business models and markets. New Ocean Data Governance models, standards, platforms, and skills are urgently needed to stimulate new market demand for innovation and sustainable development.

We believe new public-private partnerships have to be created to increase the capacity to collect Ocean Observation Data, distribute it for sustainable development, and transform our governance of ocean resources to increase wealth and conservation.",48,3,2017-08-04,1,1,5,0,2,"GIS, Mapping, Big Data, Cartography, Linked Data, Geospatial, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Spatial Data, Data Journalism, Big Data Analytics, Ocean Conservation, Ocean and Water, Sustainable Development",0

"1523","Free speech platform","New York, NY","Greetings,

We are currently in a free-speech crisis. And whether you agree with them our not, it's clear that people with alternative views from that of the mainstream are being kicked off the largest communication platforms around e.g., twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

I’m interested in starting a group around the idea of building a free-speech platform of some kind, perhaps like YouTube.

I’m looking for people that are committed to the idea of free speech. I’m also looking for uncommon types with knowledge of the current shift in our culture that seems to be happening directly under our noses and that our current rulers are trying to block at all costs.

I also need tech people, of course. I need idea people that are tech people, really. The nitty gritty code guys can come much later if the idea has legs. So we would need to meet and think about it. I think there’s a problem to solve here. We just need to know the best way to solve it. Is a new platform like YouTube the best solution? I don’t know yet.

For the uninitiated, YouTube, et al, are currently gearing up for a massive initiative to defund and remove content creators that are disagreeable to them regardless if they’re breaking their code of conduct. And make no mistake about it, because eventually, these people will be out on their asses. I see an opportunity here though.

My background:
I’ve been a front-end developer for approximately 7 years writing JavaScript and associated tech. I’ve built apps and websites in the past and, I’ll be honest, none of them did very well. But I keep trying anyway. Now, however, I’m more interested in problem-solving; the kind of high-level thinking that happens way before any code gets written. I think I’ve learned enough from my failures to know not to be so anxious to want to immediately lay down code.

In today’s business environment, we need to know more than just HOW to work with different technologies. We need to have the skills to decide on WHAT technologies and designs to use and explain WHY our technology decisions satisfy the business needs. To achieve this, we need to go back to core computer science and software engineering fundamentals. Solid understanding and realization of fundamental principles is often a key factor in whether a project will fly or sink, or a startup will take off or not.

I have spent the last three decades or so in building enterprise systems. I have worked in government projects as well as projects with financial and telecom institutions. I also founded my company http://avier.tech to invest in individuals and corporations wanting to create and launch their own software products.

"1618","Three.js NYC","New York, NY","Three.js NYC's Mission n Vision n Stuff:
The mission of Three.js NYC is to help developers bring more 3D to their applications, and to support the adoption of Three.js among NYC's vibrant web dev community. If the group can become a hotspot for people to team up to create the next big thing in 3D awsomeness in the browser, so much the better.

So, what is this ""Three.js"" of which you speak?
Three.js is a Javascript Library that enables the creation of 3D content that runs in the browser. This can be an entire web application as a 3D Scene, or can be smaller 3D elements embedded within the traditional 2D page. Three.js takes advantage of WebGL (Web Graphics Library) , the JavaScript API that renders 3D graphics within any compatible web browser and without the use of any plug-ins (such as the Unity engine, required by Second Life). The Canvas element is not required for rendering a 3D Scene--it can live in a div, a section tag, what have you. Content can be both interactive and dynamic, with x, y, z position and rotation values, as well as jpg and png material surfaces loading from a database. 3D objects out-of-the-box include Planes, Cules, Spheres, Toruses (donuts), Cylinders, Pyramids, among other basic forms. For more ambitious geometries, such as sofas, sports cars and dinosaurs, well these can be created in other programs, such as Maya or Blender, and then loaded into your Three.js Scene. Individual 3D elements and the Camera may be animated, allowing for self- and guided-tours of the 3D Scene. Any 3D element can be to listen for click events, which can be harnessed to run slideshows, open URLs, load data, trigger animations, play audio or video--the sky's the limit.

Discover Three.js...Because wasn't the Web supposed to already be 3D by now?
In the early days of the web, circa 1990's, so 20-25 years ago, self-appointed ""visionaries"" assured us with great confidence that before long, the ""information superhighway"" would evolve into a richly immersive, virtual experience--pushing your shopping cart down a 3D aisle, for example. And yet, as we all know, this is not quite the direction the Web ended up going. The realities of processing overhead, web connection speed and band width (or lack thereof), lack of scripting languages to get the job done and steep learning curves, saw to that. Instead, 3D sought greener pastures in game development, which were less reliant on an internet connection for their performance. Meanwhile, the Web itself sort of hunkered down with the 2D page paradigm, culminating in the ""flat design"" aesthetic which has dominated web design since the rise of mobile.

In this Three.js Meetup, we challenge the dominance of 2D websites in the browser (and on your phone), by starting with a simple question: If processing speed, bandwidth and technology are no longer such huge obstacles, why wouldn't we want a 3D alternative to, say, LinkedIn, Facebook or Amazon? Are there UI-UX (User Interfacer / User Experience) issues that make this impractical? Is it as simple as people don't want all the bells and whistles when all they want to do is buy a book or post their vacation photos? Will the 3D web come, but with the browser being leapfrogged by wearables, namely the headset? In this Meetup, we hope to get closer to some answers as we develop our Three.js skills, inspire each other and, hopefully, lay claim to our share of the wide-open real estate that is currently the vacant and undeveloped 3D Web.

The Three.js Meetup is led by Code Immersives Director, Brian McClain, an early adopter of 3D in the browser. Check out 3Doozy.com, which is a 3D Scene-builder CMS that Brian coded as a solo experimental project in 2011-12, using Actionscript 3.0 and the Away3D Flash-based library. (Don't bother opening the site on your phones--it's Flash). Brian is currently working on transferring the code base from Actionscript-Away3D to Javascript-Three.js, and is eager to share what he has learned in over 3,000 hours of independent work on this project.

In addition to featuring presentations on Three.js and its possibilities, the Meetups will be hands on, with pair programming activities. Following the main presentation, coders will be paired up and provided with starter files. The starter files will provide prompts and partial code as a springboard for experimenting with Three.js features and functionality. Basic Javascript ability will certainly be a plus for participating in the code-alongs, but all are welcome.

Meetups will be held, free of charge, at the Code Immersives training center at 630 9th Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10036 (at 44th St), just one block from Times Square. Three.js Meetups will be held approximately monthly. All Three.js Meetups will be cross-listed with Code Immersives Meetups, but not all Code Immersives Meetups will be about Three.js. Code Immersives-branded Meetups will encompass a Javascript-centric mix reflecting our school's state-approved curriculum, including MERN Stack, API's, ES6 and Javascript Libraries, including, but not limited to Three.js.

If you have read this far, you have probably joined the group, so welcome aboard!

See you there then!

We bring together wall street bankers, blockchain companies, wealth management, banking and capital markets, and insurance to tackle the biggest issues facing the financial services industry. With professionals across tax, assurance, and advisory practices, we can work together ways to thrive even in a period of uncertainty. Whether you're preparing for regulatory changes, putting FinTech/InsurTech to work, rethinking your human capital strategy or building business application of blockchain technologies.

For years, or even decades, companies pursued the same old business models (usually selling goods or services, building and renting assets and land, and offering people’s time as services) and tried to execute better than their competitors did. But now, business model disruption is changing the very nature of economic returns and industry definitions. All industries are seeing rapid displacement, disruption, and, in extreme cases, outright destruction. The financial services industry, with its large commercial and investment banks and money managers, is no exception.

WHO SHOULD JOIN
Entrepreneurs, investors, evangelists, enthusiasts, researchers, coders and other members of the digital ecosystem specifically interested in a practical, business application of blockchain technologies. The basic rules of the game for creating and capturing economic value were once fixed in place.

STRATEGIC VISION
Blockchain is a comprehensive technology that has the tremendous potential and power to disrupt most industries over the coming years and change radically our perception and roles that business, state, government, economic development and science play in human life.

Decentralization and P2P (peer-to-peer) governance systems can help define a new path for the progress of humanity. The time for the big change in this world has come and it needs input from as many community members as possible.

You are welcome to join the group and feel free to invite your friends, colleagues and acquaintances.
